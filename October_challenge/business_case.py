Project Title:
Rising Complaints Among Customers

Problem Statement / Introduction
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  is a U.S. government agency established to promote fairness and transparency in the financial sector. Our data team is tasked with analyzing and interpreting consumer complaint data to uncover actionable insights.
At CFPB, we regularly collect complaints from consumers across the United States concerning various financial products and services. Each complaint is logged, tracked, and monitored from initial submission to company response.
Recently, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of customer complaints, raising concerns about service quality, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust. Understanding the underlying factors driving these complaints is crucial for both regulators (to enhance oversight) and financial institutions (to improve customer experience and compliance practices).

Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
* Identify complaint patterns across financial products, services, companies, and geographic regions.
* Evaluate company responses to determine responsiveness, resolution effectiveness, and adherence to consumer protection standards.
* Highlight key areas of concern for both regulators and consumers to support data-driven policy decisions and business improvements.

Scope
This project focuses on analyzing consumer complaint data provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The analysis will cover:
* Timeframe: The dataset includes complaints recorded within the period provided by the CFPB dataset.
* Data Coverage: Complaints related to financial products and services, including credit cards, loans, mortgages, and bank accounts.
* Analytical Focus: The study will emphasize descriptive and inferential analytics to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in complaint behavior and company responses.

* Tools and Techniques:
    * Python for data extraction, transformation, and correlational analysis.
    * Power BI for visualization and reporting.
    
Out of Scope:
* Large-scale data engineering tasks (e.g., automated ETL pipelines, real-time data streaming).
* Predictive modeling or machine learning beyond basic correlation analysis.
* Direct customer or company-level investigations beyond the available dataset.

Expected Outcomes
By the end of this analysis, the following outcomes are expected:
* A comprehensive analytical report detailing key trends, patterns, and correlations within consumer complaint data.
* Interactive Power BI dashboards visualizing complaint volumes, company responses, and product-level performance.
* Actionable insights highlighting potential areas of improvement for financial institutions and regulatory focus areas for the CFPB.
* Recommendations for improving consumer satisfaction and strengthening response efficiency within the financial sector.
